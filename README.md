# CNN
Convolution Neural Networks
This is my notes on learning CNN aka Convolution Neural Networks

Some Definitions of my own:
Convolution : Convolution is a process in which we amplify the image/signal/sensor etc to make/view it bigger for our reference. Say suppose if we have an input image or signal , we will convolve with a kernel or feature extractor so that the features of the image can be amplified and extracted.

Filters / Kernels : Filters or kernels are the convolution matrix(matrices) we use to convolve to extract features from the input image

Epoch : Executing our Neural network model one time through our entire data base of images is called Epoch. Eg : Say , My data base has 50 images for which i have to do Image classification , then if my Neural network model executes on all the 50 images once i.e it completed one epoch. We will give how many epochs we want to run while we are fitting our model.
